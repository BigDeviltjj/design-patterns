## Design patterns samples

implemented by c++

---

### Creational patterns

#### abstract factory

make an interface for a bunch of related classes and many of their derived classes.

#### builder

separate a complex object's construction with its representation.

#### prototype

changes values passed in to get new objects without defining many derived classes.

#### singleton

only allows user to instance one object for one class.

---

### Structural patterns

#### adapter

unify different interfaces.

#### bridge

separate API and Implementation so that they can be modified individually.

#### composite

make list of objects and single object share same API.

#### Facade

offer a unified interface which hidding complex system operation.

#### Flyweight

describes how to share objects, which can save memory.

#### Curiously recurring template pattern

realize Static polymorphism.

---

### Behavioral  patterns

#### chain of responsibility

decouple the request the class receives by adding more classes to handle it.

#### command

decouple transmitter and receiver so that transmitter only knows how to send command while but does not know how it works.

#### observer

when the observered class changes, other classes observing it are notified and changed.

#### iterator

used in container to traverse a container without knowing how container is structured.
